    <h1>How to Make Fluffy Melt In Your Mouth Cod</h1>
    <body>Ingredients
        For the Cod:
        <ul>4 cod fillets (about 6 oz each), preferably fresh and boneless</ul>
        <ul>Salt and pepper, to taste</ul>
        <ul>Lemon wedges (for serving)</ul>
        <ul>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</ul>
        <ul>For the Batter:</ul>
        <ul>1 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul> 1/4 cup cornstarch (adds extra crispiness)</ul>
        <ul>1 tsp baking powder (for puffiness)</ul>
        <ul>1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional, for extra flavor)</ul>
        <ul>1/2 tsp paprika (optional, for color and flavor)</ul>
        <ul>1/4 tsp salt</ul>
        <ul>1/4 tsp black pepper</ul>
        <ul>1 cup cold sparkling water (or cold beer, for a beer batter version)</ul>
        <ul>1 tbsp rice vinegar or white vinegar (helps with crispiness)</ul>
        <ul>For Frying:</ul>
        <ul>Vegetable oil or canola oil (for frying, enough to submerge the cod fillets)</ul>
        <ul>Paper towels (for draining)</ul>
       <ul>Equipment Needed:</ul> 
       <ul>Deep fryer or large, heavy-bottomed pot (at least 3 inches deep)</ul> 
       <ul>Tongs or a slotted spoon</ul> 
       <ul>Thermometer (optional, but helps maintain oil temperature)</ul>
        <ul>Bowl (for batter)</ul>
        <ul>Plate lined with paper towels (for draining fried cod)</ul>
        <h3><ul>Instructions</ul></h3>
       <ol>Step 1: Prepare the Cod Pat the cod fillets dry using paper towels. This ensures that the batter sticks well and the fish fries up crispy.
        Season the fillets: Sprinkle both sides of the fish with salt and pepper. If you like, you can also season them with a pinch of garlic powder or paprika for added flavor.
        </ol> 
       <ol>Step 2: Make the Batter
        Combine the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (if using).
        Add the wet ingredients: Slowly add the cold sparkling water or cold beer, and vinegar, whisking until the batter is smooth. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but still runny enough to dip the fish. If the batter seems too thick, add a bit more water (a tablespoon at a time) until you reach the right consistency.
        </ol>
        <ol>Step 3: Heat the Oil
            Heat the oil: Pour enough vegetable oil into a deep fryer or large pot to fully submerge the cod fillets (about 3–4 inches of oil). Heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer to check the temperature, or test with a small drop of batter—it should bubble up immediately when dropped in the oil.
            
            Note: Keep the oil temperature steady. If it drops too low, the batter will become greasy; if it's too high, the fish may burn before cooking through.
            </ol> 

        <ol> Step 4: Fry the Cod
            Dip the cod fillets: When the oil is hot, dip each cod fillet into the batter, ensuring it's well coated. Gently shake off any excess batter.
            Fry the fillets: Carefully lower the battered fish fillets into the hot oil using tongs or a slotted spoon. Do not overcrowd the pot; fry in batches if necessary. Fry the fillets for about 4–6 minutes, turning them occasionally to ensure even cooking. They should be golden brown and crispy on the outside, and the fish should flake easily when tested with a fork.
            Drain the cod: Once fried, remove the cod fillets and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.
          </ol>
        <ol>Step 5: Serve
            Garnish: Sprinkle the fish with a bit of salt and garnish with fresh chopped parsley if desired.
            Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side. You can also serve the fried cod with tartar sauce, malt vinegar, or your favorite dipping sauces.
           </ol> 
           
           <ul>Tips for Perfect Fried Cod:</ul>
           <ul>Temperature control: Maintaining the right oil temperature is key. Too hot, and the batter will burn; too cool, and it will be greasy.</ul> 
           <ul> Freshness matters: Fresh cod fillets are ideal, but if you’re using frozen cod, make sure to thaw it completely and pat it dry before battering.</ul>
           <ul> Alternative seasonings: If you prefer a more robust flavor, try adding cayenne pepper, onion powder, or even a bit of Old Bay seasoning to the batter for a kick.
            <ul>Double frying: For extra crispiness, you can fry the fish twice. First, fry until just golden, then remove and let it rest for a few minutes. Reheat the oil and fry the fish for an additional 1–2 minutes for extra crunch.</ul>
         <h4><ul> Optional Sides:</ul></h4>
           <ul> French fries or chips (for a classic fish and chips experience)</ul>
            <ul>Coleslaw or green salad</ul>
           <ul>Pickles or fried pickles</ul> 
           <ul> Malt vinegar or tartar sauce for dipping</Ul>
        Enjoy your crispy, golden, deep-fried cod!

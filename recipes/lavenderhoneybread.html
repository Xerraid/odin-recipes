            **Instructions**  </ul>
            <ol>1. **Prepare the oven:**  
               Preheat to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.
            </ol>
            <ol>2. **Mix the dry ingredients:**  
               In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground lavender.
            </ol>
            <ol>3. **Combine the wet ingredients:**  
               In a separate bowl, whisk the melted butter, honey, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.
            </ol>
            <ol>4. **Make the batter:**  
               Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Do not overmix.
            </ol>
            <ol>5. **Bake:**  
               Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 45–55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
            </ol> 
            <ol>6. **Cool and serve:**  
               Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack. Garnish with lavender buds if desired. Serve warm with butter or extra honey.
            </ol>
